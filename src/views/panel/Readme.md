# (Split Panels) Panel

The (Split Panels) Panel wraps the contents of a single split panel.

It consists of a header and the body, which is typically some other 
logFile viewer, or document editor. 

The header consists of the title of the entity contained in the body, as 
well as a dropdown menu which is used to switch the body contents between 
different "open" objects.
